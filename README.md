# workshop-design-environment

Welcome to the repository for design environments.

Here you'll find the following:

* `primer.sketch` which is the starting point for the workshop.
* `library.sketchpacks` which allows us to synchronise plugins without any issues.
* `workshop.library` which allows us to synchronise styles across files
